This means that every change made to the code must also be distributed under LGPL. Normally, users, distributors and integrators don't need to change the platform code, which means that their part of the license agreement is fulfilled by informing somehow the user of the license of PhenoTips, and provide a link to the default sources. External programs that talk to PhenoTips through other means don't have to be LGPL, any license is acceptable. This includes custom components, plugins or authenticators included in the platform, and remote tools that communicate through HTTP.
